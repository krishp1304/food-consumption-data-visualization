# Food Consumption Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **global food consumption patterns** using official data from the **FAO Food Balance Sheets dataset** published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

The goal of the project is to understand how food consumption varies across countries, food categories, and time through clear and interpretable data visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** FAO Food Balance Sheets (UN official data)
- **File used:** `FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv`
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains country-wise food supply and consumption statistics across multiple years, covering various food items and categories.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

---

## 🔍 Data Processing Steps
1. Loaded and explored a large real-world dataset.
2. Converted the dataset from **wide format to long format**.
3. Filtered data to focus on **food supply quantity (kg/capita/year)**.
4. Cleaned the data by removing missing and zero values.
5. Prepared the dataset for visualization and analysis.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
The project includes **six key visualizations**:

1. **Top 10 Most Consumed Food Items**  
   Identifies the most widely consumed food items globally.

2. **Food Consumption Trend Over Years**  
   Shows how average food consumption has changed over time.

3. **Top 10 Countries by Food Consumption**  
   Compares per-capita food consumption across countries.

4. **Food Consumption by Category (Stacked Bar Chart)**  
   Displays the contribution of major food categories over years.

5. **Share of Major Food Items (Donut Chart)**  
   Highlights the percentage contribution of major food items to total consumption.

6. **Heatmap of Food Consumption (Country vs Food Item)**  
   Provides a comparative view of consumption patterns across countries and food items.

## 📌 Key Insights
- Staple foods such as cereals dominate global food consumption.
- Significant differences exist in per-capita food consumption across countries.
- Overall food consumption patterns show gradual variation over time.
- A small number of food categories contribute a major share of total consumption.
